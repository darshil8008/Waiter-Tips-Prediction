# Waiter-Tips-Prediction
Machine learning model to predict how much tip will be given to the waiter.  

Downloaded the dataset from kaggle.  

Have used Linear Regression Model for the predictions and also tested the performance of the model by giving inputs to this model according to the features that I have used to train the model.
